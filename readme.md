## üíª Project

1. <strong>HTML & CSS</strong>:
  - The initial structure with HTML I've thought in organising my containers through the tag form and adding up the following inputs which're necessary for this project. In addition with the properly formatted of html tags for the entire body.

  - As my HTML structure have been implemented, I've decided to work with the Flexbox technique to organize my containers and styling. Perhaps should I tried the grid layout which also works reasonably well and clean for this case.

  - Let's look into the insights for me about this project which was using the propertie 'resize: none' of the textarea through CSS changes, forbidden the user to resize the textarea.

  - Another amazing point which I've discovered was a website called https://cssgradient.io/ which I can create instantaneously any gradient that I want.

  2. <strong>JavaScript</strong>:
  - I've learned several different new ways of thinking about this project, even if it looks simple and is a completely basic challenge to understand and solve. But I really thriving in practice and leveling my understanding multiple times more in JavaScript after concluded this one.

  - My steps to achieve the logical solution for this was:
  - Create the main variable to getElementsById from my form.
  - Create an event method of submit and prevent of double-checking of the submit input or button.
  - Collecting the value from id of each input. I've found another ways to simplify this but I'll keep it simple according to my needs.
  - If all fields are filled, reset the form and shown the popup window of confirmation.
